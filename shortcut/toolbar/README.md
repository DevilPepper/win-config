# Recycle Bin Toolbar

This is for having the recycle bin on the right side of the taskbar. Having it on the desktop is ugly and pinning it to quick access requires opening explorer just to do something like right clicking it and opening CCleaner.

There isn't a short easy way to set this up, though. Here are the steps:

- Right click the taskbar and select `Toolbars > New toolbar...`
- Type `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\win-config\shortcut\toolbar\Recycle Bin` in the Folder textbox and hit `Select Folder`
- Right click the taskbar and uncheck `Lock the taskbar`
- Right click the separator and uncheck `Show Text` and `Show title` and check `View > Large Icons`
- Finally Right click the taskbar and check `Lock the taskbar`
