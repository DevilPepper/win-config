# Configurations for Windows

There's a Powershell profile that's similar to my bash profile
and some registry files for stuff like cmd colors.

## Getting started

```bash
cd win-config
cp Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 $profile
```

Look in `registry/` and import the registry settings you want.
